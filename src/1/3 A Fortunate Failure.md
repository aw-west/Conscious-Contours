# A Fortunate Failure
### John Swain

It’s interesting to think how a bad outcome for one party can lead to salvation for another, whether failing to succeed always mean failure.

It was early February 2009 and I was a fresher at Bangor University, full of delusions that three years in Snowdonia would turn me from a fluffy haired weekend warrior into a hardened mountain god. The winter season had started with a bang, offering amazing early season conditions across the whole country, especially in North Wales. I had met Tom Ripley the previous summer in the French Alps and it didn’t take much to persuade him to hitch down from the Lake District for a weekend of winter climbing. Another chance meeting on Beinn Eighe the previous winter had led to me climbing with Hamish Dunn; following a quick phone call, his axes were in the car and he was blasting up the M6 from Nottingham. After the awkward introductions, they seemed to get on. The three of us crammed into my single room, surrounded by a mountain of kit, and we set about deciding what to climb.

With snow down to the ground across Snowdonia, the choices were seemingly endless. After furiously flicking through an old copy of *North Wales Winter Climbing*, we made the decision to go big! Jubilee Climb, a five-pitch grade V on Clogwyn Du’r Ardurr, “Cloggy,” one of the biggest cliffs in the area high on Snowdon. After packing and re-packing, the three of us bedded down and tried to curtail our shared psyche for the next day’s adventure.

The alarm went off early. With minimal faff, the three of us were up, fed and in the car, leaving Bangor’s students to their snakebite-induced slumber, racing toward Llanberis in my mighty Suzuki Ignis. We parked near the Snowdon railway, shouldered our packs and – as dawn did its best to break through the morning clouds – started racing up the 90-minute walk to Cloggy. Shrouded by the arrogance of teenage youth, we assumed that no one else would have the nerve to climb on Cloggy in winter and were taken aback as we reached the halfway station to see a team ahead of us. This only sped us up. As we ran past them with youthful enthusiasm, we were relieved to hear they were heading to a different route. Nothing could stop us now.

We arrived at the base of the route soaked in sweat, and shared awkward smiles as we stared up at the seemingly blank and horribly steep corner. A game of rock-paper-scissors meant Tom got the first pitch. He set off, after one false start, on a bold and protection-less traverse across vertical reeds and grass to the foot of the corner.

As Hamish and I joined Tom at the belay, the corner seemed to rear up even more. Nevertheless, our confidence was high and another game of rock-paper-scissors meant it again fell to Tom to slay the beast. However, after emptying the tank, Tom admitted defeat having been quashed at the crux and returned to the belay. Following another rock-paper-scissors, Hamish geared up in silence for his bite at the cherry. What followed made tense viewing as Hamish picked his way upward, crampons smearing on the smooth walls, axes torqueing and hooking on whatever he could find.

“I feel physically sick!” he shouted down, panting as he reached the belay.
“We don’t care,” came our heartfelt reply.

This was it; we’d slain the beast, victory was ours! Although, with all our focus on the route, we’d failed to notice a change in the weather. The wind had picked up bringing with it every winter climber’s mortal enemy, spindrift, and lots of it. Things also felt notably warmer than they should have considering Cloggy’s elevation. After Tom followed up without fuss, it was my turn. As I dismantled the belay, I looked up to find the corner had become a raging torrent of spindrift. The following 45 minutes were an exercise in persistence and holding my breath. As I leant into the corner to look for axe placements, I moved into the spindrift’s line of fire and quickly became buried. Every time I looked up to work out the next few moves, snow would race into any exposed opening in my clothing, creating a layer of snow between my skin and jacket. Thankfully, I was on the safe end of the rope, and this whole process proved to be the highlight of the day for Tom and Hamish, as they laughed at me from above, nicely sheltered from maelstrom. I got to the belay ledge a swearing ball of more snow than man and we decided to do a quick time check before setting about the final few pitches to glory.

“Shit!”

It was 4pm. How had this happened? It had taken us the whole day to climb two pitches! We looked down to the base of the cliff to see the team we had passed on the walk in strolling back to the safety of the valley and the warmth of the pub.

“But we are so much younger and fitter than them!”

We had about 30 minutes left of daylight, and with the worsening weather we decided to admit defeat and leave the route for another day. We quickly sorted our kit and in one long abseil were all safely back on the ground. Amazed that what had taken us several hours of struggle was reversed in a little over 10 minutes. We had been well and truly put in our place, and set off on the long walk back to the car, tails between our legs, but happy to be in one piece.

“Help!”
“What?”
“I didn’t say anything mate.”
“Help!”
“Hamish, did you hear that?”
“Hear what mate?”
“Help!”
“Tom, stop a minute.”
“Why?”
“Help!”
“I definitely heard it that time. Someone’s calling for help. Can you see anyone?”
“Help!”
“There, look!”

In the fading light, Hamish pointed to what looked like a person some 150m above us on a broken section of cliff. I set off sprinting uphill, with Tom and Hamish shouting directions from beneath.

“Left, keep going up towards that small icefall.”
“Help!”
“Keep going, about 20 metres above you.”
“Help!”

I looked up as the shouts grew louder, heart racing, sweat running down from under my helmet, to find a man, slumped in the snow, jacket torn, shivering.

“Are you ok? What’s happened?”
“I was walking. I think, I’ve fallen. My chest hurts. Have you seen my friends?”

As Hamish and Tom arrived, I began checking the guy over. I’d recently done a mountain first aid course, but the man needed more help than we could offer so Tom called mountain rescue. We gave him our spare layers and hot juice, and did our best to warm him up while we waited for the helicopter. As I attempted to keep the man awake and Tom remained on the phone to mountain rescue, Tom’s headlamp illuminated another body about 20m above us, face down in the snow. Hamish and Tom went to help, but our help was useless – the man hadn’t survived the fall.

The next few hours passed like seconds as we waited for the mountain rescue team scrambled from Llanberis to join us. Before we knew it, a helicopter had arrived and taken the two casualties to Bangor hospital. As the helicopter took off with the second casualty, the three of us were left sat in the darkness wondering what had just happened, how had a day climbing turned into a mountain rescue? We were then told that the helicopter would return to take us off the hill. I initially refused, but didn’t have much say in the matter and we were soon being winched into a Sea King and flown down to the valley, Cloggy flashing before our eyes.

It was a surreal moment as we climbed out of the helicopter, harnesses and crampons still on, and were taken into the Nant Peris mountain rescue base. Statements were given, we were fed and watered, and then allowed to drive back to my halls of residence. I couldn’t tell you what time we got back, only that we sat and chatted, before quickly succumbing to sleep.

“Well, that was a big day.”
“What shall we do tomorrow?”
“Sleep.”

It feels strange writing this over 10 years down the line. The first man we found did survive, and we later heard his story as we were all interviewed by Reader’s Digest, who published an article on the events of that day. Though many questions persisted. If we were better climbers, would we have finished the route and failed to hear the cries for help? Was our perceived failure necessary for the man to survive? While those questions don’t need answers, they remained circling in our heads for a long time afterward.

Climbing, by its nature, is often a goal-orientated pursuit and – especially when you’re new to climbing – not reaching the top feels like failure. As time progresses and experiences accumulate, you learn from these failures and apply what you have learnt to become a better climber. The succeed-at-all-costs approach to climbing can result in a short climbing career, as the lines between risk and reward become dangerously blurred. If the opposite of failure is success, then surely the only success is to be around to climb another day.
