# The Road to the Dolomites
### Tom Conroy

With quarantine cancelling all climbing for the first half of the year and with time for the imagination to run wild, big plans started to boil and brew in the mind. A recent move to the continent had made bigger mountains a more accessible proposition, but whilst it is one thing to dream big, you need the skills to back up such the crazy ideas.

A slight relinquishing of the lockdown in Barcelona led to an opportunity to warm the fingers up on featured building walls and the free outdoor climbing wall called La Foxiada. The nights were long, and filled with traversing the walls, reminiscing of past climbs and discussing future goals. From Fedrico, my climbing partner, the availability of a car and Italian passport led to the idea to drive to the Dolomites, the home of big alpine rock routes.

Fedrico being European has that annoying continental European ability to hang around on small holds in steep terrain, whilst figuring out complex beta, a perfect counterpart to my classic English ability to stand around on moderate routes placing gear and working out where to go next. We both had a skillset to share with each the other, but what we didn't have was any real experience on the long multi pitch routes we would encounter high in the Italian Alps.

As May came around, we were allowed out of solitary confinement and into the rather beautiful prison yard of Catalunya. Climbers from the city flocked to Llieda and Tarragona, anxious to get back to hard sport, but with the fire of the Dolomites burning strong in us, we headed out in search of something a bit more esoteric, something that might prepare us for our alpine trip.

Multi Pitch One -: Arqueologia -Trans-mediterranea - - la Faclonera - - 360m

**Lesson 1:** Expect rock of the worst quality

Arqueologia Trans-mediterranea (which translates to Trans-Mediterranean Archeology), a perfect route name, it is memorable, short and sweet, and has an air of superiority. Something about archeology always brings to mind daring heroes or explorers uncovering ancient Egyptian pyramids for the first time. However, any route name that can be associated with excavating loose rocks to find ancient rusty artefacts should serve as a warning for to the avid climber.

It was a journey more than a climb, which involved traversing ledge systems for 250m across a hulking pile of limestone above the crashing sea before, before exiting 100m up the classic route via Chani. Apart from being loose and vegetated, the climbing was rarely hard, but route finding was problematic. The addition of loose blocks crumbling beneath us and the ability to throw holds you didn't like over your shoulder, to watch them crash down into sea below, provided what a UK guidebook would call "atmosphere".

"If I were an anchor, where would I be?" was a commonly muttered question and confirmation was always provided on finding the remnants of old pegs. An irreversible abseil after the fourth pitch 4 added commitment and the searing afternoon sun added a dose of suffering.

The unwanted grand finale came down to exhaustion and a lack of attention. As the last two pitches trended down towards the sea, we trended upwards past a pair of angry old sea birds protecting their young, towards a thread on a beautiful clean steep slab of rock. On arrival, to my horror, the thread was barely holding the weight of the flaking carabiner and with no slings on my harness and no other protection - I set about undoing my daisy chain, which was girth hitched to my harness, to use instead. The stiffest and boldest moves of the climb came next and led by the grace of God to a rusty two- bolt anchor.

Off route, and about one pitch off before the home straight and on the familiar ground of via Via Chani, I quested out a second and final time across a delicate traverse on rotten rock whose only casualties were two handholds and a foothold, which were destined to be washed up on the beaches to the west. Glistening titanium bolts leading up towards the sky signalled the end of our hardship and after three gorgeous pitches on bullet hard limestone - we sat atop the cliff, 10 hours after we started, well burnt, well beat and well silent.
