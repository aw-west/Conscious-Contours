# The Road to the Dolomites continued

Multip-Pitch Two -: Aresta Ribas - - POLLEGÃ“ OEST, Montserrat - - 320m

**Lesson 2:** A long day out on a big bit of rock is hard to beat, no matter how easy

The serrated mountain, Montserrat, is the centre of the soul of Catalunya. An alien world of high conglomerate towers, for the most part utterly featureless until on closer inspection a vertical cobblestone road is revealed. If you follow the cobbles of various sizes and protrusions, from football-sized boulders to golf ball stones, you shall soon reach your destination. Little known about outside of Catalunya, this mountain, if you can call it that, is steeped in rich climbing history and ethics.

Pollego Oest is the most prominent swathe of rock on the usually broken south face. Rising up 300m vertically from the ground, it is broken up by huge ledges, which - although they take away from huge potential exposure, offer amazingly comfortable belays and a spot to contemplate the beauty of your surroundings. The climbing on this route is always pleasant, bold in places, but always pleasant and protected where it needs to be. It's just pure pleasure, climbing a big hunk of rock in the afternoon sun. What could be bad about eating sandwiches 200m off the ground watching peregrines dive down from the surrounding towers onto unsuspecting prey below whilst the cool breeze brings silence and the knowledge you have of your own private corner of the world. If our multipitch spirits were pummeled by the first route, this route was surely the revitalizing tonic.

Multip-Pitch Three -: Mutant World - - Pic de Martells - - 150m

**Lesson 3:** Good rope management not only saves you time but also saves reduces you Suffering

Our third escapade entailed driving up into the Garraf National Park, just above the scene of our first epic on the sea cliff of La Falconera, to a limestone escarpment called Pic de Martells. Driving up the mountain, you can see exactly where you are going, you can even see the buttress of which our the route follows. Unfortunately, the parking is at the top of the peak and you approach the crag from above, which makes it extraordinarily difficult to find a giant 200m high limestone cliff. With no discernible footpath, you essentially just keep walking down hill until you eventually walk over the precipice.

It took us a while to get to the route, but full of stoke we quested on up, leaving our bags at the bottom in the hope of abbing back down and exiting up another route. A 6b variant presented itself at the top of the second pitch and in our infinite wisdom we followed it under a giant overhang to an intermediate hanging belay on the lip. Swapping leads, I set off up the pitch, which felt significantly harder than 6b in the Spanish summer heat. Finding and I found myself unable to bypass the crux, and I was lowered back down and handed over to Fedi. This utter faff on the belay led to a tangle in the rope comparable to a complex celtic Celtic shield design. After no upward movement (or downward for that matter) for over half an hour, we finally sorted out our rat's nest and Fedi fought his way up the pitch.

Back on "easier" ground, I climbed the last two pitches on compact limestone, pleasantly run out between bolts and with plenty of opportunity to thread rock bridges for extra protection. The movements were wonderful, and at the top we felt that both the route and us we had both redeemed themselves ourselves from the atrocities of the 6b pitch. Now well behind schedule and not wanting to get ourselves in anymore '"situations", we abbed down to the bags and made a quick exit stage left.

Multi-Pitch Four -: GAM Diedre - - Montserrat North Walls - - 180m

**Lesson 4:** If you have put the time in, have confidence in your abilities.

This route is the Cenotaph Corner of Spain, a laser-cut 90-degree corner, sheer on both sides rising for 180m with a black splitter crack separating the left and right walls. After 100m, the plum vertical corner turns over hanging negative and arches over you for 25m until the lip. Intimidating is the word I would use. This would be the litmus test for our readiness for the Dolomites. Harder and more committing than any of the other routes, we had limited time left in the day and therefore a needed for to be efficiency.

The first pitch climbed beautifully, stemming and laybacking, placing plenty of gear in the perfect hand crack between sparse rusty pegs. The change over at the belay was smooth and timely, and Fedi linked the next two pitches together, more climbing up the corner before stepping out onto the left face for 10m to a ledge. I had drawn the straw for the overhanging corner, only time would tell if it were a long or short straw. Standing at the belay looking out from the wall, there is with 100m of air below the arching rock wall, and there was nothing for me to do but take a deep breath and commit.

Strenuous laybacks were the name of the game, stopping only when necessary to place gear. The pump was setting in fast and by the time I got to the crux in the upper section of the overhang I was fighting. A big jug allowed momentary respite before small but deep pockets on the right wall led to technical bridging, looking down between your legs you can no longer see the wall you just climbed, only the trees over 100m below you. Thoughts flick to the last cam you placed, you can feel the air below you and gravity seems to be sucking you down into the abyss. Digging deep, I made the last big moves to pull around the lip and a new looking piton rewarded me with safety and comfort. We swapped leads again, with no issues, no tangles, no worries, and Fedi finished off the last corner pitch to the summit where we sat in amazement at how beautiful the climb was and how smoothly it all of this went.

We had planned to do one more multipitch before we set off for the Dolomites, but an unforeseen car registration plates plate issue and an increase in COVID-19 cases meant that the next time we would be on real rock would be half-way on through our drive to the Dolomites, abseiling down into the Verdon Gorge. Though I suppose that is a story for another time.
