# Raeburn’s Gully
### Jonny West

I look down over my left shoulder. The gully gushes down from me, past Gareth who is perched on a shelf offering a waist belay, rushes around a choke stone, and spills out onto a boulder field seven pitches below me with the loch shore further below that. Rich and I have simultaneously climbed on lead to just below the cornice. Rich is close below and right of me. The cloud cover is touched pink and orange, as the sun disappears over the horizon hidden behind the cornice. It has been about 10 hours since we started the walk in from the car. Now it is decision time for me.

Someone seems to have ascended right to top out in a past time, but Rich reminds me of the guidebook’s advice against navigating right over the precarious avalanche-prone cornice. Yet, from my tensed position, traversing left appears far more exposed. My mind has warped the modest positive gradient of the gully into a vertical slab of ice. I make a tentative attempt to start the traverse left, but – under the leering cornice and with one ice axe – immediately back out.  My heart rate picks up. I look through my legs, and catch a blurred impression of Gareth. I imagine the impatience with which Gareth and Rich sense my hesitation. A terror courses through my being. I’m suddenly very aware of the lack of protection between me and Rich, and between Rich and Gareth. The sensation of a thought shoots through me: one wrong move, a misplaced ice pick, a poorly weighted crampon spike, and the consequences...

As the person on the lead end of the rope, I cannot delegate the decision to anyone else. Though in truth there is no decision to make, there is no backing down. I must commit to the traverse and forget the appeal of the right top out. I attempt to concentrate on my breathing. My focus narrows. I commit cautiously but with intention, trying to anticipate Rich’s movements. In the repetition of moving one limb at a time, my concentration is alternately distilled to a pin prick on the end of the crampon or axe before exploding free. In this cyclical pattern of contraction and expansion, I traverse a knife-edge between debilitating terror and transcendence.

Above Lochnagar, translated as Loch of the Goat or Little Loch of the Noisy Sound, rises Cac Carn Beag, humorously translated as Little Pile of Shit. Though part of the Royal Estate of Balmoral, Queen Victoria was apparently unimpressed, having reportedly stated “But alas! Nothing whatever to be seen; and it was cold, and wet, and cheerless.”

Though its reputation as a heap of shit was apparently corroborated by an empress, Lochnagar was no little pile to us. In the way that novices do, we made a mountain out of a pile of goats’ shit. Despite writing this while safely sat at my desk, with the spring sunshine bursting through the window and music playing in the background, the experience continues to hold a strong power over me. The climb ranks among the most acute experiences of my life.

Brilliantly ill-prepared, we had set our fantasies on scaling a gully in Scotland’s southern Cairngorms. Equipped with five days’ worth of winter skills training in marginal winter conditions, some questionable navigational skills, a modest ability to comprehend mountain weather and avalanche reports, some brand new or recently borrowed equipment (including one axe each, some nuts and slings), and a lot of love for one another mixed with sibling pride, we trooped off to scale an empress’s pile of goats’ shit.

Despite our best efforts at self-sabotage, the weather had decided to side with us for the day – a pleasure seemingly unbefitting of an empress. Visibility during the three-hour walk in was near perfect. Perhaps we should have turned back the moment Lochnagar came into view after rounding the small woodland in which we parked. It was immediately clear that this loch imposed its presence on the surrounding landscape. But not us, our fantasies had long since run away with our hearts. As Lochnagar continued to bounce in and out of view as we trooped in our mountain boots along a winding 4x4 track, we were enticed ever deeper into wonderland.

We were far from the near whiteout conditions of the previous two days in Cairngorm’s northern corries. The previous day, we had decided to turn back from an attempt to skirt Cairn Gorm in the hope of reaching an east-facing crag, which we anticipated would shield us from the westerly wind. It may have done, but the strong gusts dissuaded us from even attempting to cross the exposed high ground. On that occasion, caution had prevailed. Perhaps, given our disappointment at turning back, we were more committed and persistent this day.

We reached the base of Raeburn’s Gully as in a dream. The landscape dropping to a placid loch beneath us and out onto the majesty of Cairngorm’s central plateaux. A muse for the most romantic of 19th century poets. As we began to rope up, with harness and crampons already fitted, secured on a marginal anchor, an epic of miscommunication, ill-informed decision-making and haste awaited us.
