# A Coronavirus Diary, in which birds visit an empty building site
### Penny Newell

skies light with arrival
or what you once called
without any explanation
“the orange hum of birds”

I. Tuesday
We stopped and looked at animals for a long time – black sheep to be specific. Then when you mentioned the birds waking me up being a nice way to be woken at 5am I realised it is springtime, that I know this orchestra as the sound of home.

\*

i’m fond of your phraseology
how you love the bir-hum
though you cannot
name the orange calls

II. Saturday and/or Monday
I felt sad actually we all felt sad that day, everyone, I imagined, absolutely everywhere. We hung out with our sadness in our separate rooms, houses, flats, gardens, yards, countries. Then after maybe days an evening that is fuller than any previous rehearsal.

nor any wings
muffled reason
 for unpaired arrival

III. Saturday and/or Tuesday
There is an episode of a TV show where the sky is exactly how I’m trying to describe it. What’s that? Oh this friend has written cryptic clues to species of insects and is fashioning a board game. What’s that? Oh someone else on Instragram pinching a lump of gritstone tied to an encyclopaedia.

\*

I heard they heard
 about the raved
nights we had
that they picked up
our shiny exasperated
signal calling out


IV. Every Wednesday
does weekly shop, soaps veg, drinks tea, sputters through pull-ups, dances alone to her favourite song, remembers the sound of figurine splints of granite ricocheting down a gulley in France, wonders if fear has brief, sharp forms and soft, languorous forms, moisturises hands, writes trashy poem about feeling domestic, reads poem to a flock of seagulls, throws poem into river, sanitises hands of day
