# Editor’s Note

It is with some pride I write this, the final piece in the Wonder Beyond puzzle. Let’s not dwell on the fact that the winter edition is published in summer or, that the lockdown themes may not be relevant at this moment in time. Nature never rushes but everything is accomplished. I’m amazed at the quality of writing and reflectiveness of my friends and brothers. The ethos of Wonder Beyond is something ephemeral and by that I don’t have a concrete definition. It is a response to being outdoors and what these activities mean to us. I hope it is an alternative look at the everyday pursuits we find so much meaning in. I hope you find something that resonates with you and perhaps inspires you to plan something fun.

If you would like to contribute to the next edition the theme will be spring. Spring can be hopeful time of year and I

### Enjoy! Richard West
