# Editor’s Note

It is with some pride that I write this, the final piece in this project. Conscious Contours has over time metamorphosed into a whole different beast since first conceived. Akin to the way in which I can remember vividly those climbing routes that were far more challenging than first imagined, this project has been immeasurably more work than I expected. However, it has also been far more satisfying for that fact.

It does strike me that outdoor pursuits may seem trivial when we are faced with the global pandemic that is Covid-19. However, the advice is simple: stay indoors with a good online outdoor zine at your fingertips. If, like me, you’ve already plumbed the depths of YouTube and Instagram, hopefully this will offer another space and maybe even a new perspective. In this respect, I am grateful that lockdown has happened, it has reignited my love of reading and writing – something I thought I had left behind with my A-levels. The lockdown has also brought about the tagline for this project, which is an excerpt from a Buddhist sutra: Interaction brings involvement, otherwise each keeps its own. I hope you enjoy perusing these articles and that they may inspire you in some way.

The plan for Conscious Contours will be four editions one for each season. This edition is based around winter. The next will of course be spring! If you have something to contribute, please contact me: contributors@consciouscontours.com
