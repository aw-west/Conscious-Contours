# Editor’s Note

It is with some pride that I write this the final piece in this project. Conscious Contours was originally my brother's idea however over time has metamorphosed into a whole different beast. Akin to the way in which I am able to remember vividly the climbing routes that were far more challenging that first imagined, this project has been immeasurably more work than I expected. But being far more satisfying for that fact. 

It does strike me that outdoor pursuits may seem trivial when faced with the global pandemic that is Covid-19. However, the advice is simple stay indoors with a good online outdoor zine at your fingertips. If, like me you’ve already plumbed the depths of youtube / instagram hopefully this will offer another space, maybe even a new perspective. I am grateful that lockdown has happened, it has reignited my love of reading and writing something I thought I had left behind with my A-levels. The lockdown also brought about the tagline for this project which is an excerpt from a Buddhist sutra: Interaction brings involvement, otherwise each keeps its own. I hope you enjoy perusing these articles and they inspire you in some way.

The plan for Conscious Contours will be four editions one for each season. This edition is based around winter. The next will be of course spring! If you have something to contribute please contact me on: contributors@consciouscontours.com

### Enjoy, Rich
