I stand in the death of moments,
a mausoleum to the fantastical and inescapably finite.

I am the child of these lives and deaths.
I am carried ever higher on the wave of their bounded vitality.

I am grateful for their having been.
I paint the canvas of my life in the colours of their passings.

I look to the possibilities of moment to come,
seeing moments new bud from the fertile gift of moments past.

And so I learn to face the death of moments with equanimity and the reassurance that one day the next sentence won't start with I.
