# n+1 nonsense
### Jonny West

Does the world need the gravel bicycle when it already has cyclocross, mountain and touring bicycles? What does bikepacking offer that traditional touring didn't already?

After taking a 16-year-old, steel-framed touring bicycle fitted with rim brakes and a traditional pannier setup through the Bartang Valley, Tajikistan in late autumn, I was convinced that the answer to these questions was no. Much of the hype around the hard-to-pin-down gravel bicycle felt like another instance of that deeply irritating cycling principle, n+1 - a recipe for insatiable want.

However, my cynicism took a bloody beating after I rolled up to the pier in Arnside, England for the Dales Divide 2020. Sure, I finished the 600km cross-country route with all 26,000m of climb on my 16-year-old touring bicycle. But for the week following, I could barely walk. My ankles resembled tennis balls and I struggled with tendon pain in both feet. Meanwhile, my contorted back muscles meant that lying down was no fun either. Ibruprofen and my brother's sofa got me through that week.

While the experience hasn't damped my enthusiasm for long-distance, off-road cycling, I'll be approaching future rides differently. I'll be riding a lighter rig to make it easier to push through boggy moorland, I'll distribute my gear more evenly around the frame rather than in two rear panniers to reduce the weight on the rear wheel, and I'll ride with disk brakes to minimise the corrosive effect of mud on braking force - carrying your bicycle downhill because you can't brake is â€¦ unpublishable.

Yet despite my apparent change of heart, the situation remains nuanced. A lot of the attention to gravel bicycles and bikepacking in YouTube videos, Facebook posts and industry magazine articles seems little more than hype. My second-hand, mid-range bicycle would have been fine for the Dales Divide if I'd taken a more relaxed approach. My problems were the result of the intensity of riding near constantly for 81.5 hours.

The suggestion of the n+1 principle is that to improve our performance we should upgrade our gear. What the Dales Divide 2020 taught me is that while this is true, it is only true for the very few moments in which we wish to perform at our peak ability. Otherwise, for most of us, most of time, the premium price paid for an ultra-light, high spec gravel bicycle is expensively unnecessary - an entry-level Shimano Tiagra groupset will prove more than adequate.

Instead, we would do far better to look at our mental preparation, physical condition and skillsets. Focus training on our relative weaknesses, eat healthier and sleep better, and we will perform better. Afterall, this is where the deeper satisfaction with one's performance comes from. Do these things, then invest wisely in n+1 with the knowledge gained along the journey to performance. n+1 is nonsense without experience.
