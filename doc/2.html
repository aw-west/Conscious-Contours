	<h1>The Road to the Dolomites</h1>
	<h3>Tom Conroy</h3>
	<p>With quarantine cancelling all climbing for the first half of the year and with time for the imagination to run
		wild, big plans started to boil and brew in the mind. A recent move to the continent had made bigger mountains a
		more accessible proposition, but whilst it is one thing to dream big, you need the skills to back up such the
		crazy ideas.</p>
	<p>A slight relinquishing of the lockdown in Barcelona led to an opportunity to warm the fingers up on featured
		building walls and the free outdoor climbing wall called La Foxiada. The nights were long, and filled with
		traversing the walls, reminiscing of past climbs and discussing future goals. From Fedrico, my climbing partner,
		the availability of a car and Italian passport led to the idea to drive to the Dolomites, the home of big alpine
		rock routes.</p>
	<p>Fedrico being European has that annoying continental European ability to hang around on small holds in steep
		terrain, whilst figuring out complex beta, a perfect counterpart to my classic English ability to stand around
		on moderate routes placing gear and working out where to go next. We both had a skillset to share with each the
		other, but what we didn't have was any real experience on the long multi pitch routes we would encounter high in
		the Italian Alps.</p>
	<p>As May came around, we were allowed out of solitary confinement and into the rather beautiful prison yard of
		Catalunya. Climbers from the city flocked to Llieda and Tarragona, anxious to get back to hard sport, but with
		the fire of the Dolomites burning strong in us, we headed out in search of something a bit more esoteric,
		something that might prepare us for our alpine trip.</p>
	<p>Multi Pitch One -: Arqueologia -Trans-mediterranea - - la Faclonera - - 360m</p>
	<p><strong>Lesson 1:</strong> Expect rock of the worst quality</p>
	<p>Arqueologia Trans-mediterranea (which translates to Trans-Mediterranean Archeology), a perfect route name, it is
		memorable, short and sweet, and has an air of superiority. Something about archeology always brings to mind
		daring heroes or explorers uncovering ancient Egyptian pyramids for the first time. However, any route name that
		can be associated with excavating loose rocks to find ancient rusty artefacts should serve as a warning for to
		the avid climber.</p>
	<p>It was a journey more than a climb, which involved traversing ledge systems for 250m across a hulking pile of
		limestone above the crashing sea before, before exiting 100m up the classic route via Chani. Apart from being
		loose and vegetated, the climbing was rarely hard, but route finding was problematic. The addition of loose
		blocks crumbling beneath us and the ability to throw holds you didn't like over your shoulder, to watch them
		crash down into sea below, provided what a UK guidebook would call "atmosphere".</p>
	<p>"If I were an anchor, where would I be?" was a commonly muttered question and confirmation was always provided on
		finding the remnants of old pegs. An irreversible abseil after the fourth pitch 4 added commitment and the
		searing afternoon sun added a dose of suffering.</p>
	<p>The unwanted grand finale came down to exhaustion and a lack of attention. As the last two pitches trended down
		towards the sea, we trended upwards past a pair of angry old sea birds protecting their young, towards a thread
		on a beautiful clean steep slab of rock. On arrival, to my horror, the thread was barely holding the weight of
		the flaking carabiner and with no slings on my harness and no other protection - I set about undoing my daisy
		chain, which was girth hitched to my harness, to use instead. The stiffest and boldest moves of the climb came
		next and led by the grace of God to a rusty two- bolt anchor.</p>
	<p>Off route, and about one pitch off before the home straight and on the familiar ground of via Via Chani, I
		quested out a second and final time across a delicate traverse on rotten rock whose only casualties were two
		handholds and a foothold, which were destined to be washed up on the beaches to the west. Glistening titanium
		bolts leading up towards the sky signalled the end of our hardship and after three gorgeous pitches on bullet
		hard limestone - we sat atop the cliff, 10 hours after we started, well burnt, well beat and well silent.</p>

	<h1>What's It Worth to You?</h1>
	<h3>Tim Carne</h3>
	<p>The Grampians and Mount Arapiles are the centre of rock climbing in Victoria. Many consider these places to be
		the best in Australia and are a must for visiting international climbers. The Grampians is a massive bush and
		sandstone range, known for its bouldering, sport and adventurous trad climbing. Close by is Mount Arapiles, a
		striking quartzite formation rising out of the vast and flat Wimmera plains. It is known as the trad climbing
		mecca of Australia and home of the infamous 'Punks in the Gym' (32 / 5.14a / 8b+), a climb at one time believed
		to be the hardest in the world.</p>
	<p>Earlier this month, two of the Grampians most iconic crags, Taipan and Bundaleer, were closed by the local state
		authority. The closures were over issues concerning the management of Australian Indigenous artefacts located in
		these areas. This did not come as a total surprise, as closures have been implemented for similar reasons at
		other notable crags in the Grampians since the end of 2018, while 'Special Protection Areas', which cover large
		portions of the park with other restrictions on climbing and potential fines, have also been established.
		Despite this, the closures of Taipan and Bundaleer have hit particularly hard given their significance to the
		climbing community and the feeling that, if even these places cannot remain open, then perhaps the worst is yet
		to come â€“ the worst case scenario being the closure of significant portions of Mount Arapiles, which is by no
		means a far-fetched proposition. Earlier this year, an area at the mount, known as Declaration Crag, was closed
		due to the 'rediscovery' of nearby artwork. This artwork cannot be seen with the naked eye, requiring specialist
		archaeological equipment to detect.</p>
	<p>I don't think that people outside of climbing or people who don't have similar passions of their own can
		comprehend the intense personal connection that climbers have to this sport and the places where it is done. I
		think of all the people over the last few decades who have lived in the Grampians and at Mount Arapiles to
		pursue their love of climbing. Climbers who elect to live in tents, cars or campervans, sometimes for years at a
		time, with little to no money, pursuing their thirst for progression and the testing of themselves, or simply
		just for the love of the culture of climbing and the landscapes in which it is done. To think of all those who
		change their lives to live out in these parts just to be near the rock that is the focus of such passion and
		personal connection, not to mention the community it provides for people who feel otherwise disenchanted by the
		standard options of modem living. All those who take long drives every weekend to be in these places, from
		Melbourne, Adelaide or even further, committed to the fatiguing life of the dedicated weekend warrior. These are
		people to whom these places are deeply significant, as evidenced by their continual presence. Many will say that
		what these places are being closed for is worth the loss to climbers. I don't think so. If you are a climber who
		agrees with these closures, I think that you should have more faith in the integrity of your own experience.
		Climbing embodies an important part of the human spirit, which should not be subdued by current political and
		media trends.</p>

	<h1>The Solace of the Open Page</h1>
	<h3>Richard West</h3>
	<p>Have you ever stayed up at night wondering what life as a Wyoming rancher would be like? Well, you can rest up
		tonight with a copy of Gretel Ehlrich's 'The Solace of Open Spaces'. This gem will take you on a journey through
		space and time to a distant (and great?) America. Show me the person who doesn't enjoy a bit of escapism in
		these tumultuous times? The collection of carefully constructed prose are autobiographical and tell the story of
		a woman coming to terms with grief by moving to the wilderness. The world she inhabits is far removed from
		today's comfortable urban existence, as exemplified by the Basque shepherd who refuses medical treatment and
		instead packs sheep manure into his boot as a remedy for a cut. Yet, this was only 40 years ago in Wyoming. If
		adventure is embracing the unknown, this book is chronicle of that.</p>
	<p>The book starts with an almost academic tone, Gretel as the outsider observing people in Wyoming. However, by the
		end, I felt she had become truly enmeshed and part of the community she is writing about. The boundaries between
		them and her become blurred. As Gretel writes about the cowboys she meets, "they don't know how to bring their
		tenderness into the house and lack the vocabulary to express the complexity of what they feel". As a community
		mental health nurse, I have worked with a lot of people who struggle to come to terms with their experience and
		for a number of reasons don't have the language to express it. We can all be overwhelmed by the experiences we
		have and for Gretel the slow pace of life in Wyoming was the antidote she needed to feel grounded and take
		control of her own story. Instead of life happening to her it felt like she had made some conscious decisions to
		live in her own way. I feel this and suspect it might be one of the major reasons I end up spending so much of
		my time outdoors, climbing and walking. I can feel in control of my life in a way that doesn't translate to my
		working or home life.</p>
	<p>One of the thought I had following this book was how Gretel had been content moving to Wyoming and slowed down
		her pace of life. I found myself wondering whether if I had moved to Wyoming I would rather be focussed on
		finding training and recording my achievements in my UKC logbook. Rather than the experience and the hills
		effect on me. Always trying to catalogue and classify my experiences rather than simply having them. This book
		reminded me about the importance of being present in my outdoor pursuits and not always thinking about the next
		thing.</p>
	<p>Akin to Zen Buddhism, Gretel observes the impermanence of the weather in Wyoming, observing an aliveness in the
		rhythms of the landscape and how this relates to our own psychology. "Everything in nature invites us to be what
		we are. We are often like rivers, careless and forceful, timid and dangerous, lucid and mudied, edying and
		gleaming, still." This meditative writing is reminiscent of Nan Shepherd's 'The Living Mountain', written over
		50 years earlier and over 4000 miles away. The remoteness of Wyoming gave Gretel the time to observe the
		changing nature of her consciousness, notice the subtle contours of her thoughts. Her lyrical prose describes
		the contradictory nature of our own personalities sometimes analytic and at times emotional. The comparisons
		with zen come through in the total feeling I had when I finished the book, it was a calm and collected read. The
		sentences seemed to take their time in the same way I imagine how a zen priest would lay the table.</p>
	<p>Finally, the line 'Disfigurement is synonymous with the whole idea of a frontier. As soon as we lay our hands on
		it, the freedom we thought it represented is quickly gone'. I am guilty of fantasising about what the life of a
		mountain hermit would be like. But would you really trade your freedom to choose from the banquet of modern life
		for the freedom of the hills? Maybe in fiction we can straddle both worlds.</p>

	<h1>n+1 nonsense</h1>
	<h3>Jonny West</h3>
	<p>Does the world need the gravel bicycle when it already has cyclocross, mountain and touring bicycles? What does
		bikepacking offer that traditional touring didn't already?</p>
	<p>After taking a 16-year-old, steel-framed touring bicycle fitted with rim brakes and a traditional pannier setup
		through the Bartang Valley, Tajikistan in late autumn, I was convinced that the answer to these questions was
		no. Much of the hype around the hard-to-pin-down gravel bicycle felt like another instance of that deeply
		irritating cycling principle, n+1 - a recipe for insatiable want.</p>
	<p>However, my cynicism took a bloody beating after I rolled up to the pier in Arnside, England for the Dales Divide
		2020. Sure, I finished the 600km cross-country route with all 26,000m of climb on my 16-year-old touring
		bicycle. But for the week following, I could barely walk. My ankles resembled tennis balls and I struggled with
		tendon pain in both feet. Meanwhile, my contorted back muscles meant that lying down was no fun either.
		Ibuprofen and my brother's sofa got me through that week.</p>
	<p>While the experience hasn't damped my enthusiasm for long-distance, off-road cycling, I'll be approaching future
		rides differently. I'll be riding a lighter rig to make it easier to push through boggy moorland, I'll
		distribute my gear more evenly around the frame rather than in two rear panniers to reduce the weight on the
		rear wheel, and I'll ride with disk brakes to minimise the corrosive effect of mud on braking force - carrying
		your bicycle downhill because you can't brake is â€¦ unpublishable.</p>
	<p>Yet despite my apparent change of heart, the situation remains nuanced. A lot of the attention to gravel bicycles
		and bikepacking in YouTube videos, Facebook posts and industry magazine articles seems little more than hype. My
		second-hand, mid-range bicycle would have been fine for the Dales Divide if I'd taken a more relaxed approach.
		My problems were the result of the intensity of riding near constantly for 81.5 hours.</p>
	<p>The suggestion of the n+1 principle is that to improve our performance we should upgrade our gear. What the Dales
		Divide 2020 taught me is that while this is true, it is only true for the very few moments in which we wish to
		perform at our peak ability. Otherwise, for most of us, most of the time, the premium price paid for an
		ultra-light, high spec gravel bicycle is expensively unnece6ssary â€“ a bicycle equipped with an entry-level
		Shimano Tiagra groupset will prove more than adequate.</p>
	<p>Instead, we would do far better to look at our mental preparation, physical condition and skillsets. Focus
		training on our relative weaknesses, eat healthier and sleep better, and we will perform better. Afterall, this
		is where the deeper satisfaction with one's performance comes from. Do these things, then invest wisely in n+1
		with the knowledge gained along the journey to performance. n+1 is nonsense without experience.</p>

	<p>I stand in the death of moments,<br />a mausoleum to the fantastical and inescapably finite.</p>
	<p>I am the child of these lives and deaths.<br />I am carried ever higher on the wave of their bounded vitality.
	</p>
	<p>I am grateful for their having been.<br />I paint the canvas of my life in the colours of their passings.</p>
	<p>I look to the possibilities of moments to come,<br />seeing moments new bud from the fertile gift of moments
		past.</p>
	<p>And so I learn to face the death of moments with equanimity and the reassurance that one day the next sentence

	<h1>The Road to the Dolomites continued</h1>
	<h3>Tom Conroy</h3>
	<p>Multip-Pitch Two -: Aresta Ribas - - POLLEGÃ“ OEST, Montserrat - - 320m</p>
	<p><strong>Lesson 2:</strong> A long day out on a big bit of rock is hard to beat, no matter how easy</p>
	<p>The serrated mountain, Montserrat, is the centre of the soul of Catalunya. An alien world of high conglomerate
		towers, for the most part utterly featureless until on closer inspection a vertical cobblestone road is
		revealed. If you follow the cobbles of various sizes and protrusions, from football-sized boulders to golf ball
		stones, you shall soon reach your destination. Little known about outside of Catalunya, this mountain, if you
		can call it that, is steeped in rich climbing history and ethics.</p>
	<p>Pollego Oest is the most prominent swathe of rock on the usually broken south face. Rising up 300m vertically
		from the ground, it is broken up by huge ledges, which - although they take away from huge potential exposure,
		offer amazingly comfortable belays and a spot to contemplate the beauty of your surroundings. The climbing on
		this route is always pleasant, bold in places, but always pleasant and protected where it needs to be. It's just
		pure pleasure, climbing a big hunk of rock in the afternoon sun. What could be bad about eating sandwiches 200m
		off the ground watching peregrines dive down from the surrounding towers onto unsuspecting prey below whilst the
		cool breeze brings silence and the knowledge you have of your own private corner of the world. If our multipitch
		spirits were pummeled by the first route, this route was surely the revitalizing tonic.</p>
	<p>Multip-Pitch Three -: Mutant World - - Pic de Martells - - 150m</p>
	<p><strong>Lesson 3:</strong> Good rope management not only saves you time but also saves reduces you Suffering</p>
	<p>Our third escapade entailed driving up into the Garraf National Park, just above the scene of our first epic on
		the sea cliff of La Falconera, to a limestone escarpment called Pic de Martells. Driving up the mountain, you
		can see exactly where you are going, you can even see the buttress of which our the route follows.
		Unfortunately, the parking is at the top of the peak and you approach the crag from above, which makes it
		extraordinarily difficult to find a giant 200m high limestone cliff. With no discernible footpath, you
		essentially just keep walking down hill until you eventually walk over the precipice.</p>
	<p>It took us a while to get to the route, but full of stoke we quested on up, leaving our bags at the bottom in the
		hope of abbing back down and exiting up another route. A 6b variant presented itself at the top of the second
		pitch and in our infinite wisdom we followed it under a giant overhang to an intermediate hanging belay on the
		lip. Swapping leads, I set off up the pitch, which felt significantly harder than 6b in the Spanish summer heat.
		Finding and I found myself unable to bypass the crux, and I was lowered back down and handed over to Fedi. This
		utter faff on the belay led to a tangle in the rope comparable to a complex celtic Celtic shield design. After
		no upward movement (or downward for that matter) for over half an hour, we finally sorted out our rat's nest and
		Fedi fought his way up the pitch.</p>
	<p>Back on "easier" ground, I climbed the last two pitches on compact limestone, pleasantly run out between bolts
		and with plenty of opportunity to thread rock bridges for extra protection. The movements were wonderful, and at
		the top we felt that both the route and us we had both redeemed themselves ourselves from the atrocities of the
		6b pitch. Now well behind schedule and not wanting to get ourselves in anymore '"situations", we abbed down to
		the bags and made a quick exit stage left.</p>
	<p>Multi-Pitch Four -: GAM Diedre - - Montserrat North Walls - - 180m</p>
	<p><strong>Lesson 4:</strong> If you have put the time in, have confidence in your abilities.</p>
	<p>This route is the Cenotaph Corner of Spain, a laser-cut 90-degree corner, sheer on both sides rising for 180m
		with a black splitter crack separating the left and right walls. After 100m, the plum vertical corner turns over
		hanging negative and arches over you for 25m until the lip. Intimidating is the word I would use. This would be
		the litmus test for our readiness for the Dolomites. Harder and more committing than any of the other routes, we
		had limited time left in the day and therefore a needed for to be efficiency.</p>
	<p>The first pitch climbed beautifully, stemming and laybacking, placing plenty of gear in the perfect hand crack
		between sparse rusty pegs. The change over at the belay was smooth and timely, and Fedi linked the next two
		pitches together, more climbing up the corner before stepping out onto the left face for 10m to a ledge. I had
		drawn the straw for the overhanging corner, only time would tell if it were a long or short straw. Standing at
		the belay looking out from the wall, there is with 100m of air below the arching rock wall, and there was
		nothing for me to do but take a deep breath and commit.</p>
	<p>Strenuous laybacks were the name of the game, stopping only when necessary to place gear. The pump was setting in
		fast and by the time I got to the crux in the upper section of the overhang I was fighting. A big jug allowed
		momentary respite before small but deep pockets on the right wall led to technical bridging, looking down
		between your legs you can no longer see the wall you just climbed, only the trees over 100m below you. Thoughts
		flick to the last cam you placed, you can feel the air below you and gravity seems to be sucking you down into
		the abyss. Digging deep, I made the last big moves to pull around the lip and a new looking piton rewarded me
		with safety and comfort. We swapped leads again, with no issues, no tangles, no worries, and Fedi finished off
		the last corner pitch to the summit where we sat in amazement at how beautiful the climb was and how smoothly it
		all of this went.</p>
	<p>We had planned to do one more multipitch before we set off for the Dolomites, but an unforeseen car registration
		plates plate issue and an increase in COVID-19 cases meant that the next time we would be on real rock would be
		half-way on through our drive to the Dolomites, abseiling down into the Verdon Gorge. Though I suppose that is a
		story for another time.</p>
