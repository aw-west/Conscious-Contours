Between my feet a lock shines in the brown, Its silver paper crinked and edged with rust. My lungs say No; But down and down this treadmill hill must go.</p><p>Parishes dwindle. But my parish is This stone, that tuft, this stone And the cramped quarters of my flesh and bone. I claw that tall horizon down to this; And suddenly My shadow jumps huge miles away from me.</p>
