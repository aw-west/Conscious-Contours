<h1 id="fear-as-transcendence">Fear as Transcendence</h1><h3 id="jonny-west">Jonny West</h3><p>While winter climbing earlier this year, I found myself being captured by fear. While I recognised the feeling from sport climbing, in this isolated location, there was no simple down climb. The Elvis legs were threatening, my hand gripped tightened, my indecision increased. Yet, the panic never took over. Drawing from some ethereal reserve, I was able to take control and manage my fear. While my inexperience and lack of confidence certainly magnified my perception of the risk, the effects of being captured by panic would still have been very real. Overcoming my fear felt like a decisive and transformational moment. And it has led me to reflect on the value of embracing fear.</p><p>For much of my life, I’ve had a bashful personability. In group situations, I’m shy, self-conscious and excessively agreeable – partially explaining the appeal of stimulants to me. When asked for my preference for a restaurant, I’d say, “Oh, I don’t mind, whatever you want.” Though sometimes cute, the delegation for the decision reflected an unwillingness to take responsibility – a form of passive decision-making. This example was symptomatic of my disposition. I avoided unfamiliar situations due to the inherent uncertainty or perceived risk. By delegating or hesitating until a decision was made for me, I avoided challenging myself – and the more I avoided confronting fear, the more engrained the belief that I couldn’t confront my fears became.</p><p>Yet, as fear began to capture me in that Scottish gully, I found that my relationship to fear had begun to transform. Reflecting on this pattern now, two experiences stand as milestones in this transformational process.</p><p>The first experience came during my cycle tour around South Korea. Leaving central Seoul in the late evening, I had cycled through the night following the Hangang, happy to keep cycling rather than make camp. As I turned away from the Hangang to head east up a tributary river, the day’s first light washed over the hills, flooding me with a sense of euphoria. I wanted to embrace the sun, fist punch the sky, cry, laugh and sing. My movement felt effortless. I was floating along beside the river.</p><p>All my anxieties and self-doubts about touring in an unfamiliar country receded with the retreating darkness. It wasn’t as though this was a beautiful location, but that didn’t matter. I had no purpose other than to move forward one pedal after another. For the rest of that morning, I cycled with the sensation that every element in my universe was perfectly aligned. Of course, this moment was temporarily forgotten by the following week, as I struggled against the monsoon rains, humidity and dehydration. Nevertheless, it had existed and even now I can reach back to that memory to draw resolve when confronting the unfamiliar.</p><p>One significant realisation I took from that the decisions that led up to that moment was 7that for many of the decisions that I make, the particular decision matters less than the perceived voluntary nature of the decision, as the voluntary aspect of decision-making ensures responsibility and demonstrates agency. Having chanced on this realisation, I found myself increasingly willing to embrace unfamiliar and uncomfortable situations in other areas of my life.</p><p>My second transformational experience came two years later while cycling through the Pamirs in late October. As a severe snowstorm had already passed through the Pamirs, I and another cycle tourist that I’d partnered with a week earlier had chosen to take a shorter, but more remote route through the Pamirs. Leaving the M41 (the Pamir Highway) at Rushon, we followed the Bartang Valley upstream, aiming for Kök Jar, a 3,807m pass, which would take us onto a plateau and across to Karakul. However, as we reached Savnob, the penultimate village before Kök Jar, a second snowstorm descended. Arriving in the dark, wet and cold, and in manic spirits, the situation felt desperate. Though around 130km from Karakul, we had no idea how many days it would take us to reach Karakul. Daylight was less than eight hours and temperatures in the shadows were double-digits below zero even at around 3000m, and my second-hand equipment was untested. Moreover, no one could offer first-hand information concerning the snow condition beyond the last village, although everyone speculatively told us that the pass was already closed by snow. Worryingly, we had no idea when a third snowstorm would hit. Pinned down in a one-room homestay for four days, our host spent constantly insisted that our only way over the plateau was for his friend to drive us in a 4x4 vehicle for $300. Then, just to add a little extra spice, I came face-to-face with two wolves while going to the toilet during the night.</p><p>The uncertainty of the situation permeated every aspect of my thinking. I had made substantial compromises during the previous four months traveling to cycle through the Pamirs. Yet, everything now hung by a thread. As the days ticked by, it became increasingly clear that responsibility for the decision had been delegated to me. The situation felt extremely intense.</p><p>As I’ve reflected on these experiences, I see that they have nurtured my willingness to assume risk and endure hardship – something that I am privileged to rarely experience in daily life – which in turn has fostered my resilience and strengthened my responsibility. We each maintain a narrative about ourselves. It is built on our reflections of past behaviour and experiences, and reinforced by how other people respond to us. This narrative is essential to our well-being. It is the well pool from which we give form to our existence, and draw resilience, resolve and purpose. In its better moments, it offers coherence and comprehension of events. However, in its less generous moments, it is excessively rigid and severely restricts what we believe we are capable of. As our narratives are largely informed by past experiences and other people’s responses to us, we struggle to adapt to unfamiliar and uncomfortable situations. Yet, without revision and nurture, these narratives of self can stagnate and solidify.</p><p>If we don’t challenge ourselves, stretch the boundaries of our potential, our narratives can stagnate and solidify. Our thinking becomes captured in loops of negative self-reflection. If I tell myself I can’t speak a second language, I won’t fully commit. Then, as people respond poorly to my half-hearted attempts, my negative self-image is reinforced.</p><p>However, some notes of caution are necessary. There is the risk that the process of self-transformation can become an obsession or be commodified in which case we lose our control over the process, which appears to be the critical empowering element. Second, confronting fear needn’t involve danger, it could involve speaking attempting to speak a second language or approach a stranger. While overcoming greater uncertainty or risk appears to be associated with more profound transformations, I’m slowly learning to value the process of becoming over the state of being, and the associated preference for incremental over wholesale change. Finally, overcoming fear doesn’t necessarily mean pushing head-long into fear, it simply means embracing fear, which could result in backing down while retaining control.</p><p>After successfully crossing the plateau to reach Karakul and rejoin the M41, I turned north toward Sary Tash, the first town in Kyrgyzstan after the Tajik-Kyrgyz border. With a modest climb to 4250m, the road descended to 3163m over 40km. However, I had not accounted for conditions on the north-facing aspect. As I reached the pass, I found the road on the north aspect covered under solid ice with knee deep snow on either side. For six hours, I attempted to hike my bicycle down the steep, exposed switchbacks, falling over eight times. What I’d anticipated would take me a day, now appeared to be a three-day hike-a-bike feat. With darkness having descended on my painfully slow ice slide, and contemplating three days with little food left and mentally fatigued, I made a decision to take the taxi off the mountain. Naturally, the driver found space for my bicycle among the multitude of bags and a sheep that filled the back, and I took the last seat in the vehicle. I was and remain disappointed that I finished my cycle by taking a taxi out of the Pamirs. However, I know that my disappointment doesn’t reflect a bad decision, but rather poor planning and mental fatigue – knowing that sets me up better to succeed next time.</p><p>At core, the individual that embraces and transcends fear gains a “negative capability”, that is the ability to exist amind uncertainties, mysteries and doubt without reaching for self-deceiving comforts. And ability to live with and accept the fundamental essence of insecurity.</p><p>At the core of the transformation, is a question: do I trust and respect myself?</p>
